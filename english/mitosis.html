              <p class="conteudo">The first stage of mitosis. During this phase, some important changes are observed. Among the changes in prophase are the condensation of chromosomes, the disappearance of nucleoli and the beginning of the formation of the mitotic spindle.
              Mitotic spindles are formed by spindle fibers, which are bundles of microtubules. The microtubules that form the spindles are assembled in the centrosome, also called the microtubule organizing center.
              At this stage, we see that each duplicated chromosome is present as two sister chromatids, which are joined by their centromeres (a constriction located on the chromosome) and along their arms.</p>

              <p class="conteudo">Anaphase is the shortest phase of mitosis. It begins abruptly with the simultaneous separation of sister chromatids and is completed within a few minutes. At this stage, each chromatid begins to move towards the opposite side of the cell.
              This movement occurs as a result of the shortening of the kinetochore microtubules due to the loss of tubulin subunits. At this stage, we see the elongation of the cell and at the end of the anaphase stage we see that there is a complete collection of chromosomes at each end. </p>

              <p class="conteudo">In telophase, it is possible to notice the formation of nuclei because of the reappearance of nuclear envelopes around each batch of chromosomes. The envelopes arise from fragments of the mother cell's nucleus and other portions of the cell's endomembrane system. In addition to the nucleus, the nucleolus also reappears.
              At this stage, the chromosomes also decondense and the microtubules that are still present disappear. At this stage, mitosis is completed and the nuclei of the daughter cells enter interphase.</p>
